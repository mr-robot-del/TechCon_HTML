            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts in Silicon Valley. 
                Over the years, it has grown into an international conference, hosting over 5,000 
                attendees annually. From its humble beginnings focused on software development, 
                it now covers AI, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.
